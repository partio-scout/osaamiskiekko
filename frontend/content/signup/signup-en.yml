  <p>For more information about the Competence Disc, please complete the form below.</p> 

  <p>An essential part of the Competence Disc’s functions is having an educational institution’s recommendation for how competences gained through NGOs or in leisure time are recognised for degrees. If training through NGOs is not yet utilised in your degree programmes, the Youth Work Centre of Expertise Kentauri can organise a remote competence interpretation forum where the NGO and educational institution can collaboratively create a recommendation for training recognition. After this, the compatibility is added to the Competence Disc, where it is visible and available to everyone.</p>
